How to play Plump?<br/>
Plump is a fun card game for 2+ players. The game is about succeeding in taking the number of sticks you predicted from the beginning.

Preparations<br/>
You need a game protocol and a standard deck of 52 cards. The protocol can look like the bottom of the page.

Basic rules of the game<br/>
You must always follow the color. If you do not have a card in the suit that has been added, you can add any card you want. If you fail, a so-called "plump" is put in the game protocol, hence the name of the card game. Taking a stick means that you have the highest card of those who are laid out. Or that you added a color that no other player has. It is therefore very good to have many cards of the same suit.

1 card In the first round, all players receive 10 cards each. Then the players (clockwise) start to guess how many sticks they think they will take during this game round. You can bet on anything between 10 and 0 sticks. The number of predicted sticks must never be evenly distributed on the game protocol. The last player can not always choose what he wants. (EX about 3 players: Player 1 bets on 5 sticks, player 2 on 5 sticks, player 3 may not choose 0 sticks) After the round has been played, you see who has managed to take exactly as many sticks as they predicted. If a player succeeds, he gets a one in front of the number of sticks. See minutes at the bottom of the page.

The game rounds now continue with fewer cards at a time, according to the game protocol.

Winner When it's time for a round with only one card per person, there are several different variations. Each player can look at their card and decide if it pays or not (0 or 1 stick). Each player holds the card up in the forehead, without looking at it himself. By seeing the other cards, the player then decides whether he thinks his own card is better or worse. No player looks at any card and all chances are 0 or 1 stick.

In the end, all points are counted and the player with the most points wins.
